                <main class="about-page-font-small">Jackson Porter was born in December 1995 in Utah. As a child, he fell in love with reading. One day in the fourth grade, as his teacher was explaining long-division, Jackson, in horror, turned to his friend and said, 'I'm going to be a writer, because being a writer doesn't involve math.' He has stuck to that since.<br><br>
                
                In 2022, Jackson graduated from Utah Valley University with a B.S. in English with an emphasis in Creative Writing. In September 2022, he graduated as a full-stack web developer from Devmountain, and shortly thereafter, began a career as a front-end web developer.<br><br>
                
                As mainly a fantasy, sci-fi, and mystery writer who leaps between middle-grade and adult, Jackson looks to explore various genres with his stories. The prevalent themes in his novels tend to revolve around family, duty, destiny, and power structures. His influences include JK Rowling, Brandon Sanderson, and Stephen King, among others. He models his prose to reflect his characters, while attempting to strike a balance somewhere inbetween Sanderson and Rothfuss, while maintaining a strong pace. Right now, his favorite books include "Project Hail Mary" by Andy Weir, the "Kingdom of Grit Trilogy" by Tyler Whitesides, "Troubled Blood" by Robert Galbraith, and "The Way of Kings" by Brandon Sanderson.<br><br>
                
                Jackson is represented by Terri Baranowski of Gateway Literary Agency. </main>
